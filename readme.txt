Development of a secure, web-based secret-sharing application that allows users to share
sensitive information (e.g., passwords, confidential notes) through a generated link. The
application will encrypt the secret using Key Management Service (KMS) and provide a simple
user interface for creating and retrieving secrets. The shared secret links will have an expiration
set by the user, enhancing security. The application will be deployed on AWS with monitoring
setup via CloudWatch to track usage and health metrics.
